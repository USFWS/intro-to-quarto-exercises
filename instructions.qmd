## Overview

The objective of this series of exercises is to expose you to the many features of Quarto documents through the example of a Western Snowy Plover survey. The exercises will step you through the key elements of Quarto documents and provide you with an opportunity to explore the various components and features that will enable you to create quality documents that effectively communicate and document your analyses and findings.

In this training course, we will guide you through four exercises to enhance your familiarity with Quarto documents. The first exercise introduces you to options for **rendering** a Quarto file into a document. The second exercise focuses on understanding **YAML headers**, where you'll learn to customize metadata such as title and author. Next, you'll dive into the **document body**, exploring formatting options to organize your content effectively. Finally, you'll master **code chunks**, allowing you to embed and execute code in R, Python, or Julia, creating dynamic reports that showcase your analysis. Through these exercises, you'll develop essential skills to create professional and polished Quarto documents.

### Set up 

- Start by opening "intro-to-quarto-exercises.Rproj" in RStudio. 
- If it is your first time opening the project, run `source("install_packages.R")`  

## Exercise 1: Rendering

### Tasks to accomplish

1. Open `1_rendering.qmd`. What are three main components of the file?
2. Render the document using the RStudio GUI.
3. Render the document using the Quarto CLI.  
    - *Hint*: `quarto render <input file>`
4. Render the document using the `quarto` R package.
    - *Hint*: `quarto::quarto_render("<input file>")`

## Exercise 2: YAML metadata

A **YAML** (**Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage) header is a crucial component of Quarto documents that defines metadata for the document, typically enclosed within a pair of triple-dashed lines at the beginning of the file. It allows users to specify important information such as the document's title, author, date, and output formats (like HTML, PDF, or Word). Additionally, YAML headers can include parameters to control formatting options and customize the behavior of the document, such as including bibliographies or setting specific themes. By using a YAML header, authors can ensure that their documents are well-organized and professionally presented.

### Tasks to accomplish

- [ ] Open `2_yaml_metadata.qmd` and render the document.
- [ ] Update the title and replace the author name with your name. Re-render it. 
- [ ] Change the output to `html` and render it. View it in an editor. 
- [ ] Now render it as a PDF. What did you notice?
- [ ] [*Bonus*] Render the document as both a PDF and HTML.

## Exercise 3: Document body

### Tasks to accomplish

Open `3-document_body.qmd` and make the following changes to the document:

**Inline:**

- [ ] Italicize the species name
- [ ] Make the refuge name into a hyperlink to the refuge website

**Block:**

- [ ] Create a new header named "My list"
- [ ] Make an ordered and unordered list
- [ ] Insert an image

## Exercise 4: Code chunks

### Task to accomplish

Open `4_code_chunks.yml` and make the following changes to the document:

**Chunk Label:**

- [ ] Label the plot code chunk to help you differentiate from other chunks.

**Figure Caption:**

- [ ] Add "Mean" to beginning of caption to read "Mean monthly Western..."

**Plot:**

- [ ] Add `+ theme_classic()` to end of ggplot script to clean up plot.

**Chunk Options:** 

- [ ] Change `include` option to `false` to remove it from report.
